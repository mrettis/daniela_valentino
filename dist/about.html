       <h3 class="text-secondary">Art</h3>
       <p>An artist’s style should be recognizable 
         as easily as the patterns of a handwritten letter.  At
         least, that is what most artists should look for on the 
         journey to develop their talent. <br> <br>

        Daniela Valentino’s paintings have a fine balance of composition,
         beauty, and talent,  but what intrigues the most is her style.  
         It is honest, and direct, it communicates what she wants to say 
         clearly within the lines and the texture of her paintings.  
         Her series “Parvenze”  speaks volumes about this, she is sensually 
         descriptive without being tasteless, passionate without being cliche’.
          There, she not only shows a clear understanding of human anatomy
           but also composition. <br>  </p>
           <h3 class="text-secondary">Bio</h3>
           <p>
        Daniela has dedicated her life to art at a young age. She began her
        education under the traditional method of becoming an apprentice
        first before becoming independent. She studied under re-known Masters such 
        as Carotenuto di Giulio, Mereviglia, Fratelli Mazzella.  She formalized
        her studies at the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples, she majored in
         fine Arts and Theater where she graduated with honors.
